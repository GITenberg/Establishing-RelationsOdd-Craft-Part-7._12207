<h2>
    ESTABLISHING RELATIONS
</h2>
<p>
    Mr. Richard Catesby, second officer of the ss. <i>Wizard</i>, emerged from the
    dock-gates in high good-humour to spend an evening ashore.  The bustle of
    the day had departed, and the inhabitants of Wapping, in search of
    coolness and fresh air, were sitting at open doors and windows indulging
    in general conversation with any-body within earshot.

<p>
    Mr. Catesby, turning into Bashford's Lane, lost in a moment all this life
    and colour.  The hum of distant voices certainly reached there, but that
    was all, for Bashford's Lane, a retiring thoroughfare facing a blank dock
    wall, capped here and there by towering spars, set an example of
    gentility which neighbouring streets had long ago decided crossly was
    impossible for ordinary people to follow.  Its neatly grained shutters,
    fastened back by the sides of the windows, gave a pleasing idea of
    uniformity, while its white steps and polished brass knockers were
    suggestive of almost a Dutch cleanliness.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby, strolling comfortably along, stopped suddenly for another
    look at a girl who was standing in the ground-floor window of No. 5.  He
    went on a few paces and then walked back slowly, trying to look as though
    he had forgotten something.  The girl was still there, and met his ardent
    glances unmoved: a fine girl, with large, dark eyes, and a complexion
    which was the subject of much scandalous discussion among neighbouring
    matrons.
</p>
<p>
    "It must be something wrong with the glass, or else it's the bad light,"
    said Mr. Catesby to himself; "no girl is so beautiful as that."
</p>
<p>
    He went by again to make sure.  The object of his solicitude was still
    there and apparently unconscious of his existence.  He passed very slowly
    and sighed deeply.
</p>
<p>
    "You've got it at last, Dick Catesby," he said, solemnly; "fair and
    square in the most dangerous part of the heart.  It's serious this time."
</p>
<p>
    He stood still on the narrow pavement, pondering, and then, in excuse of
    his flagrant misbehaviour, murmured, "It was meant to be," and went by
    again.  This time he fancied that he detected a somewhat supercilious
    expression in the dark eyes&mdash;a faint raising of well-arched eyebrows.
</p>
<p>
    His engagement to wait at Aldgate Station for the second-engineer and
    spend an evening together was dismissed as too slow to be considered.  He
    stood for some time in uncertainty, and then turning slowly into the
    Beehive, which stood at the corner, went into the private bar and ordered
    a glass of beer.
</p>
<p>
    He was the only person in the bar, and the land-lord, a stout man in his
    shirt-sleeves, was the soul of affability.  Mr. Catesby, after various
    general remarks, made a few inquiries about an uncle aged five minutes,
    whom he thought was living in Bashford's Lane.
</p>

<p>
    "I don't know 'im," said the landlord.
</p>
<p>
    "I had an idea that he lived at No. 5," said Catesby.
</p>
<p>
    The landlord shook his head.  "That's Mrs. Truefitt's house," he said,
    slowly.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby pondered.  "Truefitt, Truefitt," he repeated; "what sort of a
    woman is she?"
</p>
<p>
    "Widder-woman," said the landlord; "she lives there with 'er daughter
    Prudence."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby said "Indeed!" and being a good listener learned that Mrs.
    Truefitt was the widow of a master-lighterman, and that her son, Fred
    Truefitt, after an absence of seven years in New Zealand, was now on his
    way home.  He finished his glass slowly and, the landlord departing to
    attend to another customer, made his way into the street again.
</p>
<p>
    He walked along slowly, picturing as he went the home-corning of the
    long-absent son.  Things were oddly ordered in this world, and Fred
    Truefitt would probably think nothing of his brotherly privileges.  He
    wondered whether he was like Prudence.  He wondered&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    "By Jove, I'll do it!"  he said, recklessly, as he turned.  "Now for a
    row."
</p>
<p>
    He walked back rapidly to Bashford's Lane, and without giving his courage
    time to cool plied the knocker of No. 5 briskly.
</p>
<p>
    The door was opened by an elderly woman, thin, and somewhat querulous in
    expression.  Mr. Catesby had just time to notice this, and then he flung
    his arm round her waist, and hailing her as "Mother!" saluted her warmly.
</p>
<p>
    The faint scream of the astounded Mrs. Truefitt brought her daughter
    hastily into the passage.  Mr. Catesby's idea was ever to do a thing
    thoroughly, and, relinquishing Mrs. Truefitt, he kissed Prudence with all
    the ardour which a seven-years' absence might be supposed to engender in
    the heart of a devoted brother.  In return he received a box on the ears
    which made his head ring.
</p>
<p>
    "He's been drinking," gasped the dismayed Mrs. Truefitt.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you know me, mother?"  inquired Mr. Richard Catesby, in grievous
    astonishment.
</p>
<p>
    "He's mad," said her daughter.
</p>
<p>
    "Am I so altered that you don't know me, Prudence?"  inquired Mr.
    Catesby; with pathos.  "Don't you know your Fred?"
</p>
<p>
    "Go out," said Mrs. Truefitt, recovering; "go out at once."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby looked from one to the other in consternation.
</p>
<p>
    "I know I've altered," he said, at last, "but I'd no idea&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "If you don't go out at once I'll send for the police," said the elder
    woman, sharply.  "Prudence, scream!"
</p>
<p>
    "I'm not going to scream," said Prudence, eyeing the intruder with great
    composure.  "I'm not afraid of him."
</p>
<p>
    Despite her reluctance to have a scene&mdash;a thing which was strongly
    opposed to the traditions of Bashford's Lane&mdash;Mrs. Truefitt had got as
    far as the doorstep in search of assistance, when a sudden terrible
    thought occurred to her: Fred was dead, and the visitor had hit upon this
    extraordinary fashion of breaking the news gently.
</p>
<p>
    "Come into the parlour," she said, faintly.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby, suppressing his surprise, followed her into the room.
    Prudence, her fine figure erect and her large eyes meeting his steadily,
    took up a position by the side of her mother.
</p>
<p>
    "You have brought bad news?" inquired the latter.
</p>
<p>
    "No, mother," said Mr. Catesby, simply, "only myself, that's all."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Truefitt made a gesture of impatience, and her daughter, watching
    him closely, tried to remember something she had once read about
    detecting insanity by the expression of the eyes.  Those of Mr. Catesby
    were blue, and the only expression in them at the present moment was one
    of tender and respectful admiration.
</p>
<p>
    "When did you see Fred last?"  inquired Mrs. Truefitt, making another
    effort.
</p>
<p>
    "Mother," said Mr. Catesby, with great pathos, "don't you know me?"
</p>
<p>
    "He has brought bad news of Fred," said Mrs. Truefitt, turning to her
    daughter; "I am sure he has."
</p>
<p>
    "I don't understand you," said Mr. Catesby, with a bewildered glance from
    one to the other.  "I am Fred.  Am I much changed?  You look the same as
    you always did, and it seems only yesterday since I kissed Prudence
    good-bye at the docks.  You were crying, Prudence."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Truefitt made no reply; she gazed at him unflinchingly and then bent
    toward her mother.
</p>
<p>
    "He is mad," she whispered; "we must try and get him out quietly.  Don't
    contradict him."
</p>
<p>
    "Keep close to me," said Mrs. Truefitt, who had a great horror of the
    insane.  "If he turns violent open the window and scream.  I thought he
    had brought bad news of Fred.  How did he know about him?"
</p>
<p>
    Her daughter shook her head and gazed curiously at their afflicted
    visitor.  She put his age down at twenty-five, and she could not help
    thinking it a pity that so good-looking a young man should have lost his
    wits.
</p>
<p>
    "Bade Prudence good-bye at the docks," continued Mr. Catesby, dreamily.
    "You drew me behind a pile of luggage, Prudence, and put your head on my
    shoulder.  I have thought of it ever since."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Truefitt did not deny it, but she bit her lips, and shot a sharp
    glance at him.  She began to think that her pity was uncalled-for.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm just going as far as the corner."
</p>
<p>
    "Tell me all that's happened since I've been away," said Mr. Catesby.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Truefitt turned to her daughter and whispered.  It might have been
    merely the effect of a guilty conscience, but the visitor thought that he
    caught the word "policeman."
</p>
<p>
    "I'm just going as far as the corner," said Mrs. Truefitt, rising, and
    crossing hastily to the door.

<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    The young man nodded affectionately and sat in doubtful consideration as
    the front door closed behind her.  "Where is mother going?"  he asked, in
    a voice which betrayed a little pardonable anxiety.
</p>
<p>
    "Not far, I hope," said Prudence.
</p>
<p>
    "I really think," said Mr. Catesby, rising&mdash;"I really think that I had
    better go after her.  At her age&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    He walked into the small passage and put his hand on the latch.
    Prudence, now quite certain of his sanity, felt sorely reluctant to let
    such impudence go unpunished.
</p>
<p>
    "Are you going?" she inquired.
</p>
<p>
    "I think I'd better," said Mr. Catesby, gravely.  "Dear mother&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "You're afraid," said the girl, calmly.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby coloured and his buoyancy failed him.  He felt a little bit
    cheap.
</p>
<p>
    "You are brave enough with two women," continued the girl, disdainfully;
    "but you had better go if you're afraid."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby regarded the temptress uneasily.  "Would you like me to
    stay?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
    "I?" said Miss Truefitt, tossing her head.  "No, I don't want you.
    Besides, you're frightened."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby turned, and with a firm step made his way back to the room;
    Prudence, with a half-smile, took a chair near the door and regarded her
    prisoner with unholy triumph.
</p>
<p>
    "I shouldn't like to be in your shoes," she said, agreeably; "mother has
    gone for a policeman."
</p>
<p>
    "Bless her," said Mr. Catesby, fervently.  "What had we better say to him
    when he comes?"
</p>
<p>
    "You'll be locked up," said Prudence; "and it will serve you right for
    your bad behaviour."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby sighed.  "It's the heart," he said, gravely.  "I'm not to
    blame, really.  I saw you standing in the window, and I could see at once
    that you were beautiful, and good, and kind."
</p>
<p>
    "I never heard of such impudence," continued Miss Truefitt.
</p>
<p>
    "I surprised myself," admitted Mr. Catesby.  "In the usual way I am very
    quiet and well-behaved, not to say shy."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Truefitt looked at him scornfully.  "I think that you had better
    stop your nonsense and go," she remarked.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you want me to be punished?" inquired the other, in a soft voice.
</p>
<p>
    "I think that you had better go while you can," said the girl, and at
    that moment there was a heavy knock at the front-door.  Mr. Catesby,
    despite his assurance, changed colour; the girl eyed him in perplexity.
    Then she opened the small folding-doors at the back of the room.
</p>
<p>
    "You're only&mdash;stupid," she whispered.  "Quick!  Go in there.  I'll say
    you've gone.  Keep quiet, and I'll let you out by-and-by."
</p>
<p>
    She pushed him in and closed the doors.  From his hiding-place he heard
    an animated conversation at the street-door and minute particulars as to
    the time which had elapsed since his departure and the direction he had
    taken.
</p>
<p>
    "I never heard such impudence," said Mrs. Truefitt, going into the
    front-room and sinking into a chair after the constable had taken his
    departure.  "I don't believe he was mad."
</p>
<p>
    "Only a little weak in the head, I think," said Prudence, in a clear
    voice.  "He was very frightened after you had gone; I don't think he will
    trouble us again."
</p>
<p>
    "He'd better not," said Mrs. Truefitt, sharply.  "I never heard of such a
    thing&mdash;never."
</p>
<p>
    She continued to grumble, while Prudence, in a low voice, endeavoured to
    soothe her.  Her efforts were evidently successful, as the prisoner was,
    after a time, surprised to hear the older woman laugh&mdash;at first gently,
    and then with so much enjoyment that her daughter was at some pains to
    restrain her.  He sat in patience until evening deepened into night, and
    a line of light beneath the folding-doors announced the lighting of the
    lamp in the front-room.  By a pleasant clatter of crockery he became
    aware that they were at supper, and he pricked up his ears as Prudence
    made another reference to him.
</p>
<p>
    "If he comes to-morrow night while you are out I sha'n't open the door,"
    she said.  "You'll be back by nine, I suppose."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Truefitt assented.
</p>
<p>
    "And you won't be leaving before seven," continued Prudence.  "I shall be
    all right."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby's face glowed and his eyes grew tender; Prudence was as
    clever as she was beautiful.  The delicacy with which she had intimated
    the fact of the unconscious Mrs. Truefitt's absence on the following
    evening was beyond all praise.  The only depressing thought was that such
    resourcefulness savoured of practice.
</p>
<p>
    He sat in the darkness for so long that even the proximity of Prudence
    was not sufficient amends for the monotony of it, and it was not until
    past ten o'clock that the folding-doors were opened and he stood blinking
    at the girl in the glare of the lamp.
</p>
<p>
    "Quick!"  she whispered.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby stepped into the lighted room.
</p>
<p>
    "The front-door is open," whispered Prudence.  "Make haste.  I'll close
    it."
</p>
<p>
    She followed him to the door; he made an ineffectual attempt to seize her
    hand, and the next moment was pushed gently outside and the door closed
    behind him.  He stood a moment gazing at the house, and then hastened
    back to his ship.
</p>
<p>
    "Seven to-morrow," he murmured; "seven to-morrow.  After all, there's
    nothing pays in this world like cheek&mdash;nothing."
</p>
<p>
    He slept soundly that night, though the things that the second-engineer
    said to him about wasting a hard-working man's evening would have lain
    heavy on the conscience of a more scrupulous man.  The only thing that
    troubled him was the manifest intention of his friend not to let him slip
    through his fingers on the following evening.  At last, in sheer despair
    at his inability to shake him off, he had to tell him that he had an
    appointment with a lady.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, I'll come, too," said the other, glowering at him.  "It's very
    like she'll have a friend with her; they generally do."
</p>
<p>
    "I'll run round and tell her," said Catesby.  "I'd have arranged it
    before, only I thought you didn't care about that sort of thing."
</p>
<p>
    "Female society is softening," said the second-engineer.  "I'll go and
    put on a clean collar."

<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    Catesby watched him into his cabin and then, though it still wanted an
    hour to seven, hastily quitted the ship and secreted himself in the
    private bar of the Beehive.
</p>
<p>
    He waited there until a quarter past seven, and then, adjusting his tie
    for about the tenth time that evening in the glass behind the bar,
    sallied out in the direction of No. 5.
</p>
<p>
    He knocked lightly, and waited.  There was no response, and he knocked
    again.  When the fourth knock brought no response, his heart sank within
    him and he indulged in vain speculations as to the reasons for this
    unexpected hitch in the programme.  He knocked again, and then the door
    opened suddenly and Prudence, with a little cry of surprise and dismay,
    backed into the passage.
</p>
<p>
    "You!"  she said, regarding him with large eyes.  Mr. Catesby bowed
    tenderly, and passing in closed the door behind him.
</p>
<p>
    "I wanted to thank you for your kindness last night," he said, humbly.
</p>
<p>
    "Very well," said Prudence; "good-bye."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby smiled.  "It'll take me a long time to thank you as I ought
    to thank you," he murmured.  "And then I want to apologise; that'll take
    time, too."
</p>
<p>
    "You had better go," said Prudence, severely; "kindness is thrown away
    upon you.  I ought to have let you be punished."
</p>
<p>
    "You are too good and kind," said the other, drifting by easy stages into
    the parlour.
</p>
<p>
    Miss Truefitt made no reply, but following him into the room seated
    herself in an easy-chair and sat coldly watchful.
</p>
<p>
    "How do you know what I am?" she inquired.
</p>
<p>
    "Your face tells me," said the infatuated Richard.  "I hope you will
    forgive me for my rudeness last night.  It was all done on the spur of
    the moment."
</p>
<p>
    "I am glad you are sorry," said the girl, softening.
</p>
<p>
    "All the same, if I hadn't done it," pursued Mr. Catesby, "I shouldn't be
    sitting here talking to you now."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Truefitt raised her eyes to his, and then lowered them modestly to
    the ground.  "That is true," she said, quietly.
</p>
<p>
    "And I would sooner be sitting here than any-where," pursued Catesby.
    "That is," he added, rising, and taking a chair by her side, "except
    here."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Truefitt appeared to tremble, and made as though to rise.  Then she
    sat still and took a gentle peep at Mr. Catesby from the corner of her
    eye.
</p>
<p>
    "I hope that you are not sorry that I am here?"  said that gentleman.
</p>
<p>
    Miss Truefitt hesitated.  "No," she said, at last."
</p>
<p>
    "Are you&mdash;are you glad?" asked the modest Richard.
</p>
<p>
    Miss Truefitt averted her eyes altogether.  "Yes," she said, faintly.
</p>
<p>
    A strange feeling of solemnity came over the triumphant Richard.  He took
    the hand nearest to him and pressed it gently.
</p>
<p>
    "I&mdash;I can hardly believe in my good luck," he murmured.
</p>
<p>
    "Good luck?" said Prudence, innocently.
</p>
<p>
    "Isn't it good luck to hear you say that you are glad I'm here?"  said
    Catesby.
</p>
<p>
    "You're the best judge of that," said the girl, withdrawing her hand.
    "It doesn't seem to me much to be pleased about."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby eyed her in perplexity, and was about to address another
    tender remark to her when she was overcome by a slight fit of coughing.
    At the same moment he started at the sound of a shuffling footstep in the
    passage.  Somebody tapped at the door.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes?" said Prudence.
</p>
<p>
    "Can't find the knife-powder, miss," said a harsh voice.  The door was
    pushed open and disclosed a tall, bony woman of about forty.  Her red
    arms were bare to the elbow, and she betrayed several evidences of a long
    and arduous day's charing.
</p>
<p>
    "It's in the cupboard," said Prudence.  "Why, what's the matter, Mrs.
    Porter?"
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Porter made no reply.  Her mouth was wide open and she was gazing
    with starting eyeballs at Mr. Catesby.
</p>
<p>
    "Joe!" she said, in a hoarse whisper.  "Joe!"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby gazed at her in chilling silence.  Miss Truefitt, with an air
    of great surprise, glanced from one to the other.
</p>
<p>
    "Joe!" said Mrs. Porter again.  "Ain't you goin' to speak to me?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby continued to gaze at her in speechless astonishment.  She
    skipped clumsily round the table and stood before him with her hands
    clasped.
</p>
<p>
    "Where 'ave you been all this long time?"  she demanded, in a higher key.
</p>
<p>
    "You&mdash;you've made a mistake," said the bewildered Richard.
</p>
<p>
    "Mistake?"  wailed Mrs. Porter.  "Mistake!  Oh, where's your 'art?"
</p>
<p>
    Before he could get out of her way she flung her arms round the horrified
    young man's neck and em-braced him copiously.  Over her bony left
    shoulder the frantic Richard met the ecstatic gaze of Miss Truefitt, and,
    in a flash, he realised the trap into which he had fallen.
</p>
<p>
    "Mrs. Porter!" said Prudence.
</p>
<p>
    "It's my 'usband, miss," said the Amazon, reluctantly releasing the
    flushed and dishevelled Richard; "'e left me and my five eighteen months
    ago.  For eighteen months I 'aven't 'ad a sight of 'is blessed face."
</p>
<p>
    She lifted the hem of her apron to her face and broke into discordant
    weeping.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't cry," said Prudence, softly; "I'm sure he isn't worth it."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby looked at her wanly.  He was beyond further astonishment, and
    when Mrs. Truefitt entered the room with a laudable attempt to twist her
    features into an expression of surprise, he scarcely noticed her.
</p>
<p>
    "It's my Joe," said Mrs. Porter, simply.
</p>
<p>
    "Good gracious!" said Mrs. Truefitt.  "Well, you've got him now; take
    care he doesn't run away from you again."
</p>
<p>
    "I'll look after that, ma'am," said Mrs. Porter, with a glare at the
    startled Richard.
</p>

<!--IMAGE END-->
<p>
    "She's very forgiving," said Prudence.  "She kissed him just now."
</p>
<p>
    "Did she, though," said the admiring Mrs. Truefitt.  "I wish I'd been
    here."
</p>
<p>
    "I can do it agin, ma'am," said the obliging Mrs. Porter.
</p>
<p>
    "If you come near me again&mdash;" said the breathless Richard, stepping back
    a pace.
</p>
<p>
    "I shouldn't force his love," said Mrs. Truefitt; "it'll come back in
    time, I dare say."
</p>
<p>
    "I'm sure he's affectionate," said Prudence.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby eyed his tormentors in silence; the faces of Prudence and her
    mother betokened much innocent enjoyment, but the austerity of Mrs.
    Porter's visage was unrelaxed.
</p>
<p>
    "Better let bygones be bygones," said Mrs. Truefitt; "he'll be sorry
    by-and-by for all the trouble he has caused."
</p>
<p>
    "He'll be ashamed of himself&mdash;if you give him time," added Prudence.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby had heard enough; he took up his hat and crossed to the door.
</p>
<p>
    "Take care he doesn't run away from you again," repeated Mrs. Truefitt.
</p>
<p>
    "I'll see to that, ma'am," said Mrs. Porter, taking him by the arm.
    "Come along, Joe."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Catesby attempted to shake her off, but in vain, and he ground his
    teeth as he realised the absurdity of his position.  A man he could have
    dealt with, but Mrs. Porter was invulnerable.  Sooner than walk down the
    road with her he preferred the sallies of the parlour.  He walked back to
    his old position by the fireplace, and stood gazing moodily at the floor.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Truefitt tired of the sport at last.  She wanted her supper, and
    with a significant glance at her daughter she beckoned the redoubtable
    and reluctant Mrs. Porter from the room.  Catesby heard the kitchen-door
    close behind them, but he made no move.  Prudence stood gazing at him in
    silence.
</p>
<p>
    "If you want to go," she said, at last, "now is your chance."
</p>
<p>
    Catesby followed her into the passage without a word, and waited quietly
    while she opened the door.  Still silent, he put on his hat and passed
    out into the darkening street.  He turned after a short distance for a
    last look at the house and, with a sudden sense of elation, saw that she
    was standing on the step.  He hesitated, and then walked slowly back.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes?"  said Prudence.
</p>
<p>
    "I should like to tell your mother that I am sorry," he said, in a low
    voice.
</p>
<p>
    "It is getting late," said the girl, softly; "but, if you really wish to
    tell her&mdash;Mrs. Porter will not be here to-morrow night."
</p>
<p>
    She stepped back into the house and the door closed behind her.

Produced by David Widger

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
